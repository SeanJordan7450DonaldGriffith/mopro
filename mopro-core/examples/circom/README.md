# Circom examples

 Example circuits written in Circom used for testing. One basic, multiplier2, and another one slightly more involved, keccak256. The former is a good minimal circuit to test things end to end. The latter is useful for benchmarking.

 To compile circuits, run `./compile.sh` in the respective `target` directory. For `multiplier2` it is already pre-compiled.
